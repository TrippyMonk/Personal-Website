# Personal-Website

This is probably of no interest to most people.  It's simply my attempt to build a "resume" website from scratch.
I'm working on HTML and CSS skills mostly, but do plan to incorporate a headless CMS and use JavaScript to grab
blog files eventually.  For now the website just looks a bit weird with no blog posts.
